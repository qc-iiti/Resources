# Resources

Hi.

We started exploring Quantum Computing not too long ago. While recent years have made it easier to get started, good-quality material is still frustratingly scattered. Too often, we found either:
- **Pop-science articles** full of buzzwords but little technical depth, or
- **Dense research texts** written for specialists, not learners.

Basically, it was hard. We want to make it easy.

## What this Repository Is

This repository is targeted towards beginners approaching quantum computing. When we say beginner, we really do mean it. Late high-school and early undergraduate students. We expect you know how to use a computer, but we'll hold your hand through it. We expect you know basic maths, but we'll help you through the details. Quantum Computing is really cool. Its at the intersection of computer science and quantum physics and mathematics.

## How this Repository is Structured

The repository contains:
- [**OUR HANDBOOK**](./handbook/): A series of documents written by club members guiding readers in working with Quantum Computing tools efficiently. We explain
  - The Basic Idea of Qubits
  - An Introduction to Quantum Physics & Notation
  - Basic Computer Science, and how to use Python
  - Building Circuits and Algorithms
- [**EXTERNAL RESOURCES**](./RESOURCES.md): A curation of resources we found and used to teach us Quantum Computing. It includes books, video tutorials, and websites.


This repository isn’t meant to replace formal coursework — it’s a launchpad.  
We hope it helps you take your first *shot* at Quantum Computing.

> [!TIP]
> A single execution of a quantum circuit is called a shot. Multiple shots are performed to sample the distribution produced by the circuit.

Best,

The Quantum Computing @ IIT Indore Team
