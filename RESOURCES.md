#### FreeCodeCamp Crash Course

This quantum computing course provides a solid foundation in quantum computing, from the basics to an understanding of how popular quantum algorithms work. Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information at incredible speeds.

#### *Quantum Computation & Quantum Information*, Nielsen & Chaung
ISBN: 9780511976667

The Nielsen & Chaung textbook is one of the most widely cited textbooks in QC. For those looking to build a deep theoretical foundation in quantum computing, this is one of the best reference points. The first part covers an introduction to quantum computing and algorithms (§1), delves into the basics of linear algebra and quantum mechanics (§2), then into basic computer science (§3).

#### IBM Quantum Learning Platform

IBM Provides free courses teaching the basics of quantum computing. The courses are technically dense, starting from classical information and leading to algorithms, noisy systems, and error correction. It also provides courses for more focused topics, such as machine learning, variational algoriths, and more. The platform integrates tutorials with real quantum hardware through Qiskit.

#### Caltech Physics 219 / J Preskill

Preskill’s legendary lecture notes (and accompanying videos) are one of the most cited open resources in the field. They cover the mathematical foundations of quantum information, algorithms, and error correction, with both physics and computer science perspectives.

#### MIT OCW Fall 2003 Lectures

Taught by Professor Peter Shor himself, of Shor's algorithm fame, MIT OCW provides selected lecture notes as part of its Department of Mathematics course on Quantum Computation. Note, not all lectures were transcribed.

#### Microsoft Quantum Katas

The Quantum Katas are a collection of self-paced tutorials and programming exercises to help you learn quantum computing and Q# programming.The Quantum Katas also include tutorials that introduce the learner to the basic concepts and algorithms used in quantum computing, starting with the necessary math (complex numbers and linear algebra). They follow the same pattern of supplementing the theory with Q# demos and hands-on programming exercises.
